The 5-Celeb.ipynb is a tutorial on using facenet using a small 5-person dataset.  You can run through this notebook to get a feel for using
the facenet model for facial recognition.

The Celeb1-A.ipynb notebook is our notebook which uses a pretrained facenet model on a 
a 1000-person subset of the Celeb1-A dataset.
